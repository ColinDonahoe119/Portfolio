## 📂 Featured Projects

### **Two-Way Anova in R**
Using a dataset containing Gender, Major (Accounting, Business Intelligence, Marketing), and Salary, I conducted a two-way ANOVA to analyze differences in salary across groups. The results—statistically significant—revealed an interaction effect: women had higher mean salaries in Accounting and Marketing, while men had higher mean salaries in Business Intelligence.

### **Tennis Tracknet**
TrackNet is a deep learning architecture for tracking small, fast-moving objects. I used a dataset of 19,835 annotated frames from broadcasted tennis matches to train a model that predicts ball location, trajectory, player positions, and ball state (flight, hit, bounce).
This project includes the Python code that transforms a standard tennis broadcast clip into one with accurate ball, player, and court tracking overlays.
